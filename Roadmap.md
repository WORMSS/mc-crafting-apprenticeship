Roadmap
=======

### Concept
- Making medieval structures (or anything I think may fit)
- Maintaining structures (replacing nails, wood)
- Building structures takes alot of right clicking
- Pulversing wheat to flour
- Wood cutting
 

### Tools
- ? something to start it all
- Hammer
- Crowbar: normal, fast (dirty), precisions (good recovery)
- Inspection (not sure on name yet).
- Saw, (used on a block above a saw table)
- Two person saw
- Band saw
 

### Items
- Nails (from ingots or nuggets)
- Building planks (5 levels of cut, all can be burnt), Lowest level is not worth building with.
- Bag of nails. Cannot mix types of nails.
- flour
 

### Blocks
- Wood cutting table top.
- Planning table top.
- Pulverzing stone
- Stack of building planks. (Left click build up, Right click take away)
- Bag of nails block. (Left click fill up, Right click take some out)


### Multiblock
- Water Wheels (providing power)
 - Different sizes
 - Torque
 - Speed
 - Water flow
 - Stone pillers, if broken break whole wheel
 - Water placement denotes speed and direction, can cancel each other out.
 

### Leveling system
- speed in building
- speed in maintaining
- speed in planning
- efficentcy in building (material loss)
- efficentcy in maintaining (repair to full, material loss)
- efficentcy in planning (how many designs wasted)
- tool competency (hurting yourself while sawing/hammering)


#### Random Ideas
- Varnish wood (Longer lasting wood)
- Tinning nails (Longer lasting nails)
- Painting struture (not sure how to link this to maintance)
- Statue chiseling.
- Have to keep checking plans when building.
- Water wheel drive. Stress/overspeed causes more damage.
- Water wheel gearing system.
