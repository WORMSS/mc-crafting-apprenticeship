Roadmap
=======

### Concept
- Making medieval structures (or anything I think may fit)
- Maintaining structures (replacing nails, wood)
- Building structures takes alot of right clicking
- pulversing wheat to flour
- wood cutting
 

### Tools
- ? something to start it all
- Hammer
- Crowbar: normal, fast (dirty), precisions (good recovery)
- Inspection (not sure on name yet).
- Saw, (used on a block above a saw table)
- Two person saw
 

### Items
- Nails (from ingots or nuggets)
- Building planks
 

### Blocks
- Wood cutting table top.
- Planning table top.
- Pulverzing stone


### Multiblock
- Water Wheels (providing power)
 - Different sizes
 - Torque
 - Speed
 - Water flow
 - Stone pillers, if broken break whole wheel
 

### Leveling system
- speed in building
- speed in maintaining
- speed in planning
- efficentcy in building (material loss)
- efficentcy in maintaining (repair to full, material loss)
- efficentcy in planning (how many designs wasted)


#### Random Ideas
- Varnish wood
- Tinning nails
- Panting struture
(not sure how to link this to maintance)
